Welcome to the list of awesome open source and thanks for considering to contribute. Contributions are welcome so we can tap into the collective knowledge and wisdom about how to run open source.

Please [open a pull request](https://github.com/cornelius/awesome-open-source/pulls) if you would like to contribute new or improve existing items. If you would like to comment on or discuss content but don't have concrete changes yet, or if you are not sure where the new item should go, please [open an issue](https://github.com/cornelius/awesome-open-source/issues).

The scope of the list is resources helpful in running open source projects and managing use of open source. The focus is software but adjacent areas are welcome as well.

The list is not about collecting open source projects but more about the meta topic of why and how to do open source successfully.

This is a curated list so the goal is not to collect all possible resources but collect the ones which are most helpful, provide a unique perspective, or are of special significance. Resources providing an overview about an area or aspect of open source are preferred over links to specific instances or implementations. Links to specific examples are welcome, though, the description should include information what makes the examples special, then.

This list is licensed under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) so that it can broadly be used and shared by everybody. By submitting pull requests you agree to share your contributions under the same license.
